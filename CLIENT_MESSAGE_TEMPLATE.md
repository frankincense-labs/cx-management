**Subject:** CX Management Platform - Live Demo Ready for Testing

Hi [Client Name],

I've deployed the CX Management Platform to a live URL so you can fully explore and test all features. The platform is now accessible at:

**[YOUR_VERCEL_URL_HERE]**

## 🎯 Testing the Platform

To get the full experience, I recommend testing both user perspectives:

### **Option 1: Test as a Customer** (Recommended to start here)
1. Click "Sign up" on the login page
2. Fill in your details (Full Name, Email, Password)
3. **Leave the "Admin Code" field blank** (or use Google Sign-in)
4. Once signed in, you can:
   - Submit feedback with ratings and categories
   - Create support tickets with priority levels
   - View all your submitted feedback
   - Track your support tickets and see status updates
   - View your complete interaction history
   - Attach files (screenshots, PDFs) to feedback and tickets

### **Option 2: Test as an Admin** (Platform Management View)
1. Click "Sign up" on the login page
2. Fill in your details (Full Name, Email, Password)
3. **Enter the admin code: `ADMIN2026`** in the "Admin Code (Optional)" field
4. **Note:** Admin accounts must use email/password sign-up (not Google Sign-in)
5. Once signed in as admin, you can:
   - View all customer feedback across the platform
   - Filter feedback by category and date range
   - Review and manage all support tickets
   - Update ticket status (Open → In Progress → Resolved)
   - Reply to customer tickets
   - View individual customer interaction history
