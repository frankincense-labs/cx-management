I've completed the initial build of the CX Management Platform for her FinTech startup project. I wanted to share what has been developed and get your feedback on the layout and functionality before finalizing everything.

What Has Been Built:

I have implemented all the core features outlined in your project proposal:

1. Feedback Capture and Analysis 
- Customer feedback submission with 1-5 star ratings and detailed comments
- Optional category selection (General, Technical Issue, Feature Request, etc.)
- File attachment support (screenshots, PDFs) for better context
- Admin review dashboard with filtering by rating, status, and customer
- Real-time updates when new feedback is submitted

2. Support Request Tracking 
- Ticket creation system with subject, description, and priority levels
- Status tracking (Open → In Progress → Resolved)
- File attachments for tickets (screenshots, documents)
- Admin ticket management with filtering by status, customer, and priority
- Real-time status updates visible to customers

3. Personalized Communication 
- Admin reply system on tickets (asynchronous communication)
- Communication thread view showing full conversation history
- Timestamped messages for both customers and admins
- Clear visibility of who sent each message and when

4. Interaction History 
- Unified view combining all feedback and tickets
- Filter by type (All/Feedback/Tickets) and by customer (admin view)
- Chronological display of all customer interactions
- Easy navigation to full details of any interaction

Additional Features Implemented:
- Authentication System: Email/password and Google sign-in options
- Role-Based Access: Separate dashboards for customers and administrators
- Real-Time Updates: All pages automatically refresh when data changes
- File Uploads: Support for attaching images/PDFs to feedback and tickets
- Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

Current Status

The platform is fully functional and ready for review. All pages are working, data is being stored in Firebase, and the user flows are complete.

Questions I have for her:

1. Layout & Design: Are you happy with the current layout and design? Would you like any changes to colors, spacing, or overall visual style?

2. Functionality: Does everything meet your expectations? Is there anything missing or anything you'd like me to add or modify?

3. Additional Features: Are there any additional features you'd like to see that weren't in the original proposal?


Once she's satisfied with evenrything, I can help her set up:

You create a GitHub repo or I handle it (would need your credentials) :
- You can create a new GitHub account/repository
- I'll push the code to your repo
- Then I'll deploy it on Vercel for you


Deployment:
- After the repo is set up, I'll deploy the application on Vercel
- You'll get a live URL you can share
- The Firebase backend is already configured and ready

Please let me know your thoughts on the current build and which handover option you prefer.
